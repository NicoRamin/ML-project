Dropbox for files too big for Github: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ylnvcxb2tzstgenjxv4ij/AI3VNq_pOYAj260TM3D81ws?rlkey=brgq6h54b7acs925jp41ztru4&st=44h8zh61&dl=0

Some additional notes: 
- Due to file size limitations, we can only upload two Generators and one Discriminator. We have over a hundred different models coming from different training runs. If you'd like to access all models, please let us know, and we will work to find a solution. 
- We have some additional files and folders documenting prior approaches that we eventually abandoned (e.g., comparing output distributions of models, GAN using with GPT-3.5 and Phi-1.5, etc.). To maintain a structured repository, we did not include these. However, if you would like to review them, we can upload them for you. 

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the code, testing the models, formulations, or any other aspect. We are happy to help and hope our solution and interpretations meet your expectations :)
